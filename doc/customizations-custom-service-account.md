## Custom Service Account

CARTO deploys a dedicated infrastructure for every self hosted installation, including a Service Account key that is required to use some of the services deployed.

If you prefer using your own GCP Service Account, please do the following prior to the Self Hosted installation:

1. Create a dedicated Service Account for the CARTO Self Hosted.

2. Contact CARTO support team and provide them the service account email.
